# IIMS_Hackathon_2024_Best_Model_Award<br>
## IIMS Hackathon - Deep Learning Codefest
**Note That:**
This repository contains the code and resources for our participation (i.e. team of 4 members) in the IIMS Hackathon 2024, where our team developed an award-winning image segmentation model for autonomous vehicles. Our model was recognized for its accuracy and innovation, earning us the Best Model award. <br>

**Problem Statement**<br>
**Background**<br>
Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are revolutionizing transportation by promising safer, more efficient, and more convenient travel. A critical component of AV technology is the ability to accurately perceive and understand the surrounding environment in real-time. Image segmentation plays a pivotal role in this perception by enabling AVs to identify and distinguish various elements on the road, such as lanes, vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, and obstacles.<br>

**Objective**<br>
Design and train an image segmentation model on an autonomous vehicle dataset. The model must be able to segment the scene in images into 13 classes, including lanes, vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, and obstacles. The input size of the image should have a height and width of 256x256 with 3 channels.<br>

**Deliverables**<br>
**Model:** A trained image segmentation model capable of accurately segmenting the dataset classes such as lanes, vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, and obstacles.<br>
**Codebase:** A well-documented codebase that includes:
- Data preprocessing steps.
- Model training and evaluation scripts.

**Presentation:** A short presentation of 5 minutes including:
- An overview of the approach and methodologies used.
- Description of the model architecture.
- Evaluation results with performance metrics.
- Analysis of the model's performance under different conditions.
- Conclusion and potential improvements.

**Evaluation Criteria**
1. Accuracy and Correctness: How accurately and robustly the model segments images in diverse conditions.
2. Innovation and Creativity: Unique approaches and techniques used to tackle the segmentation challenges.
3. Team Collaboration and Synergy: Collaboration among team members.
4. Documentation and Presentation: Quality and clarity of the codebase and the understanding.

**Resources**
- A labeled dataset of images from autonomous vehicles provided through Slack after registration.
- Support and mentorship from industry experts.
